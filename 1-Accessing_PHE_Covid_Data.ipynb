    "Many websites support access to their underlying data through a web-based [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (an API for short). This is often based on the *http* protocol, and may involve the excange of information in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). Specifically, using a web-based API typically involves sending *http* requests with parameters conforming to a given schema to a dedicated URL (the API *endpoint*), to which the server responds with JSON content. All this is specified in the PHE [API documentation](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/developers-guide).\n",

This is a Python wrapper that facilitates access to the API by building the requests for you, forwarding them to the API access point and packaging the response into some convenient format. The PHE [Pyhton SDK](https://pypi.org/project/uk-covid19/) is found on the standard Python package repository, PyPi.\n",
