    "We will be adding interactive controls to our graphs using the ```ipywidgets``` [library](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). This is basically a Graphical User Interface ([GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)) library that runs in a notebook. Its control elements (so-called [widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_widget)) are actually an interface to [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) code that runs in your browser (in a stardard GUI library meant for desktop applications, they would be written in some low-level language and interface with the [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) on your computer). An in-depth treatment of GUIs is beyond the scope of this tutorial. However, I will strive to highlight concepts of general applicability and to use a clean syntax that highlights where the various elements fit in and may be easier to port to other GUI toolkits. If you are interested in learning more about (desktop-based) GUIs in Python, I strongly recommend the [appJar](http://appjar.info/) library - it is an excellent learning library and a great quick prototyping tool as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```ipywidgets``` library is an integral part of the Jupyter framework and should therefore already be installed on any machine you are running this notebook on. If for some reason it isn't, follow these [instructions](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html) to install it."

    "It is a good idea to provide some data on the disk for your dashboard to start on - after all, the PHE website might be offline when someone accesses your dashboard; also, accessing the PHE website directly would make startup time longer.

    "The ```ipywidgets``` library provides a ```Button``` class that implements a [clickable button](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html?highlight=button#Button). The way this is linked to your code is through a [callback function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)). This is a function that is passed as a parameter to the ```on_click``` method of the ```Button``` object, that in turn calls it when it is clicked. The callback function is passed the ```Button``` object itself as a parameter (which is useful if more than one button, for instance, shares the same callback). We can safely ignore that here.\n",

    "Adding an interactive control to a graph is not much more complicated. The control can be any of the many [widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html#) provided by ```iPywidgets```. Here we have chosen ```Select``` that allows us to select a year (see the [doc](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html#Select)). We use the year to filter the DataFrame, and display the data for that year aggregated by month as a multiple stacked bar chart \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, ```Select``` makes use of a callback, that gets passed the option that have been selected. Each time the selection is changed, the callback function is called again. The way the callback is registered with the widget is slightly different: the callback (here ```lineage_graph```) must take a single parameter (the selected year, called ```graphyear```). We then pass the callback to ```interactive_output```, together with a dictionary that specifies which widget (```year```) must provide a value for the callback parameter (```graphyear```). Basically, the ```iPywidget``` framework  calls ```lineage_graph``` with the value retrieved from the widget after each user interaction.  The value of ```interactive_output``` is an ```Output``` widget (see the [doc](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Output%20Widget.html)), that can be assigned to a variable and passed to ```display``` together with the ```year``` widget itself. Any printout, graph or other output of the callback ```lineage_graph``` is captured and displayed through that ```Output``` widget, that renders it in the browser."
