    "During the Pandemic, Public Health England (PHE) launched a Covid-19 dashboard. This timely service came with an Application Programming Interface ([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)) allowing users programmatic access to the data for the purpose of creating visualisations or data analysis. Interestingly, it also included a wrapper library written in Python, that made access to the data seamless. At the end of 2023, the PHE dashboard was [replaced](https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2023/12/21/ukhsa-data-dashboard-takes-over-from-the-coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard/) by the UK Health Security Agency dashboard ([UKHSA dashboard](https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/)). This new API, at the time of writing in the [Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) stage, includes data on various infectious diseases including respiratory and gastrointestinal, bloodstream infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases. The data are better organised and documented, and many of the quirks of the old API have been fixed.  An interesting feature of the new system is that all of its [code](https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/coding-in-the-open) has been open-sourced (though this is the type of read you most likely want to save for a later time!). On the down side, the Python wrapper has for the time being been dropped, so one needs to access the API directly, via *http* requests.\n",

    "Many websites support access to their underlying data through a web-based [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (an API for short). This is often based on the *http* protocol, and may involve the excange of information in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). Specifically, using a web-based API typically involves sending *http* requests with parameters conforming to a given schema to a dedicated URL (the API *endpoint*), to which the server responds with JSON content.
